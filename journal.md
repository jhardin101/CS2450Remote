8/31/25: Subject: first entry--Today I finished up the assignments for connecting to the git repo.

9/6/2025: Subject: Flask--followed the steps in the flask assignment to ensure that I had everything set up. In using pip, I seem to always need to add --break on the end of the command. Everything seemed to work perfectly.
