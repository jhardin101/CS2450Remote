8/31/25: Subject: first entry--Today I finished up the assignments for connecting to the git repo.

9/6/2025: Subject: Flask--followed the steps in the flask assignment to ensure that I had everything set up. In using pip, I seem to always need to add --break on the end of the command. Everything seemed to work perfectly.

9/17/2025: Subject: Design Patterns--Good book to read is "Design Patterns", aka the Gang of Four book. There is also Refactoring.guru, a website that compiles these design patterns.

10/1/2025: Subject: RISC-V postludes-- I seem to make the common mistake of moving from a saved register to a0 AFTER I've alredy changed the saved registers in the postlude. Remember to do this BEFORE the postlude.

10/13/2025: Subject: HTML/CSS-- It's been a long time since I've used HTML or CSS, so I need to get a refresher. I'm thinking of maybe watching a quick video then messing around with a copy of the youface website.

10/31/2025: Subject: Another week down -- Seems I've missed a week or two with the journal, so here's hoping I remember to keep it up! About to get started on my C assignment this week, happy halloween!

11/7/2025: Subject: selenium troubles -- Because of how selenium is misbehaving for me, going to write my tests and have a teammember whose tests work run on their machine. Hopefully that will work!
